# Inkling – The blog you'll fall in love with

Inkling is a full-stack blog application built to explore modern web development practices. It uses **React + Vite** for the frontend and **Express + MongoDB** for the backend, completing the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

The project is structured to separate concerns between frontend and backend, enabling clean, maintainable code and future scalability.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React (with Vite)
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **API:** RESTful CRUD operations
* **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication

## Project Structure Overview

```
project/
├─ client/       → Frontend application (React + Vite)
├─ server/       → Backend API (Express + MongoDB)
├─ .gitignore    → Git ignore rules for both frontend and backend
├─ README.md     → Project documentation
├─ package.json  → Root-level project configuration
├─ package-lock.json
```

The structure ensures that frontend and backend are independent yet part of a single project, making development, testing, and deployment straightforward.

## Getting Started

Since this is a full-stack application with separate frontend and backend, each part has its own dependencies and setup. The root directory contains the overall project configuration and manages both `client/` and `server/` directories.
